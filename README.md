# How to run my app:

## For Linux :

First, check if you have java installed by running `java -version` in your terminal. If it says java is not recongnized, follow the steps below. If it gives you a *valid* version, you can  skip to after the installation steps.

### For Red Hat-based systems (Fedora, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux):

    sudo dnf install java-latest-openjdk
```
**Run this code in your terminal and if it asks, put in your sudo pswd**

### For Arch Linux and Manjaro:
```bash
    sudo pacman -S jre-openjdk

After you are done with that, use the *`cd`* command to navigate to the direcotry with all the files from this repo.
